## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SaaS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

I would like to continue sharpening on CSS grid that I haven't used in this projects. I would as well like to develop my skills in SaSS

### Useful resources
